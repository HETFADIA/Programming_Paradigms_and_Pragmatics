Program name : Hangman.pl


How to run my program
1) perl Hangman.pl


The words array contains all the possible words.
A word will be chosen at random, say real_word which you will have to guess.
When the program is run the initial position of the hangman will be displayed.


Also a hidden array containing character of the true words will be displayed, eg ----(it is hidden array so true word will not be displayed)
Below it it will display an array of guessed alphabets.


You have to guess an alphabet and type it.
If you guess a string (eg “ram” instead of an alphabet ) the program will consider only the first character i.e. ‘r’.
If the guessed alphabet was also guessed earlier the program will ask to choose another alphabet.
Else if you guess a correct character the - will be replaced by the correct character.eg(b---)
If you guess the incorrect alphabet (alphabet guessed is not present in the word) the position of the hangman will be displayed.
You will be given 6 chances(correct guess are not counted) to guess the word. After 6 incorrect guesses the hangman will be hanged and you will lose.
If you guess the correct word you will win.
The program will ask you if you want to play again.
Press ‘Y’ or ‘y’ to play again and any other character to quit.
